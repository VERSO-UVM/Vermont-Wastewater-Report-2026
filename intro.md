# Vermont Wastewater Report 2026

Welcome to the Vermont Wastewater Report 2026, a comprehensive analysis of Vermont's wastewater systems, infrastructure, and environmental impacts.

## Overview

This report provides an examination of Vermont's wastewater management systems, incorporating GIS analysis, watershed mapping, and environmental resilience studies. The analysis aims to support policy development, infrastructure planning, and environmental protection efforts across the state.

Comprehensive wastewater infrastructure data is fundamental to effective environmental protection, economic development, and community planning in Vermont. Understanding the location, capacity, and condition of wastewater treatment facilities and collection systems enables state agencies, municipalities, and regional planners to assess cumulative water quality impacts, identify infrastructure gaps, coordinate investments, and respond to climate-driven challenges. Without accurate, accessible spatial data on Vermont's 170+ NPDES-permitted facilities and their discharge points, regulators cannot effectively implement Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) requirements for Lake Champlain and other impaired waters, planners cannot evaluate where growth can be accommodated, and communities cannot prioritize rehabilitation of aging systems or prepare for extreme weather events. The Wastewater Infrastructure Mapping project addresses this critical need by assembling the first comprehensive statewide dataset integrating treatment facilities, service areas, collection networks, and receiving waters—providing decision-makers with the spatial intelligence required for data-driven wastewater management.

Inadequate wastewater capacity directly constrains Vermont's ability to address its most pressing economic challenges, particularly the state's severe housing shortage. Vermont needs to triple its housing production rate—from approximately 2,650 units per year to 7,500+ units annually—to meet the Economic Action Plan's goal of 350,000 occupied homes by 2035 and support a target population of 802,000 residents. However, many communities cannot accommodate new housing development because existing wastewater treatment facilities are at or near capacity, collection systems lack available connections, or sensitive receiving waters cannot assimilate additional nutrient loading under TMDL restrictions. This infrastructure bottleneck is particularly acute in economically vibrant areas like Chittenden County and resort towns, where demand for workforce housing is highest but wastewater capacity is constrained by stringent Lake Champlain phosphorus limits or aging infrastructure. Small rural communities face the opposite problem: declining populations and shrinking rate bases make it difficult to finance even essential system maintenance, creating barriers to the modest infill development needed to sustain local economies and support aging-in-place residents. Without strategic wastewater capacity planning—distinguishing where to expand, where to consolidate, and where to optimize existing systems—Vermont cannot achieve its housing goals, retain and attract working-age residents, or reverse the demographic decline that threatens community vitality and fiscal sustainability.

The economic ripple effects of wastewater capacity constraints extend beyond housing to affect business development, property values, and municipal fiscal health. Businesses requiring substantial water use—food processing, manufacturing, hospitality—cannot locate or expand in communities without available wastewater capacity or where connection fees and user rates reflect infrastructure stress. Property values in sewer service areas significantly exceed those dependent on onsite septic systems, but this premium is threatened when systems approach capacity limits or face costly upgrades to meet tightening nutrient standards. Municipalities caught between mandated infrastructure improvements (TMDL compliance, CSO controls, aging system rehabilitation) and limited rate bases experience fiscal strain that diverts resources from other community needs and makes Vermont less competitive with neighboring states. The State Revolving Fund and Clean Water Fund provide essential support, but have invested over $200 million in Lake Champlain basin wastewater upgrades alone, highlighting the magnitude of need and the challenge of maintaining affordable service while meeting environmental standards. By mapping existing capacity, projecting future demands under multiple demographic scenarios, and identifying opportunities for regionalization and system optimization, this report provides the analytical foundation for breaking the wastewater-housing-economy gridlock and supporting Vermont's long-term sustainability.

## About This Project

This report was developed through the collaborative efforts of the [Vermont EPSCoR Research on Adaptation to Climate Change (VERSO)](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/) program at the University of Vermont. VERSO brings together researchers, students, and stakeholders to address Vermont's climate adaptation challenges through interdisciplinary research and community engagement.

The foundation for this analysis comes from the [Wastewater Infrastructure Mapping](https://verso-uvm.github.io/Wastewater-Infrastructure-Mapping/) project, a 2024-2025 initiative funded by the University of Vermont and the Leahy Institute for Rural Partnerships in partnership with the Windham Regional Commission. This project assembled a comprehensive state-wide map of Vermont's wastewater sewage lines, treatment facilities, service areas, and access points by integrating current data from multiple authoritative sources.

Student contributors participated through the [Open Research Community Accelerator (ORCA)](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/orca/) program, which provides undergraduate and graduate students with hands-on experience in open science practices, collaborative research, and real-world problem-solving. ORCA interns worked to combine spatial data, conduct GIS analysis, and develop interactive visualizations to support sustainable wastewater management in Vermont and provide decision-makers with data-driven insights for infrastructure planning and environmental protection.
